# ⚠️ RESTART YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER NOW

## The Problem
The `.env.local` file was just created, but your development server is still running with the OLD configuration (without the environment variables).

## The Solution
**You MUST restart your development server for the changes to take effect.**

## How to Restart

### Step 1: Stop the Current Server
In your terminal where the dev server is running:
- Press `Ctrl+C` (Windows/Linux)
- Or press `Cmd+C` (Mac)

You should see the server stop.

### Step 2: Start the Server Again
Run one of these commands:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Or if you're using bun:
```bash
bun dev
```

### Step 3: Wait for Server to Start
You should see output like:
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

### Step 4: Test the Map
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Navigate to "Report Issue" page
3. Click on the location field
4. The map should now load! ✅

## Why This is Necessary

Vite (your build tool) only reads environment variables when it starts. Changes to `.env.local` are NOT picked up while the server is running.

## Verification

After restarting, open browser console (F12) and you should see:
```
Map modal opened, checking Google Maps API...
Google Maps API already loaded (or loading...)
```

Instead of:
```
Google Maps API key not found ❌
```

## Still Not Working?

If the map still doesn't work after restarting:

### Check 1: Verify .env.local exists
```bash
ls -la .env.local
```
Should show the file.

### Check 2: Check the API key value
```bash
cat .env.local | grep GOOGLE_MAPS
```
Should show: `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyD7nJAmr4M4-qfzUQtubXAgWpc1P4ATh9E`

### Check 3: Check browser console
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
Look for the log: "Initializing Google Maps with API key: Present"

### Check 4: Test the API key
The API key might need:
- Billing enabled in Google Cloud Console
- APIs enabled (Maps JavaScript API, Geocoding API, Places API)
- Domain restrictions configured

## Quick Test Command

After restarting the server, run this in browser console:
```javascript
console.log('API Key:', import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY);
```

Should output: `API Key: AIzaSyD7nJAmr4M4-qfzUQtubXAgWpc1P4ATh9E`

If it shows `undefined`, the server wasn't restarted properly.
